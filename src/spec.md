# Steelcut Industries

## Current State
The application has:
- Header with company branding (logo + "STEELCUT INDUSTRIES" title)
- Header includes tagline "Quality Bending & Cutting Machines"
- Footer with company name and "Manufacturing Excellence Since 2020"
- Product catalog page
- Product details page
- Admin panel (for logged-in admins only)
- Internet Identity authentication

## Requested Changes (Diff)

### Add
- "Since 1988" tagline to header branding area

### Modify
- Update footer text from "Manufacturing Excellence Since 2020" to "Manufacturing Excellence Since 1988"

### Remove
- None

## Implementation Plan
1. Update the header branding section in App.tsx to include "Since 1988" alongside or below the company name
2. Update the footer text in App.tsx to reflect "Since 1988" instead of "Since 2020"

## UX Notes
- The "Since 1988" text should be prominently visible in the header to establish brand heritage
- Footer should consistently reflect the same year (1988) for brand consistency
